# unocss-lit-ts

This repo will show you how to use [unocss](https://github.com/antfu/unocss) with [lit]().

The `main` branch contains the code to run a simple `lit web-component`.

We are exploring `scoping css`, you can see a first attempt to make it working with `unocss per-module` on `permodule` branch. 

This repo is using `pnpm`, so if you don't have installed run `npm i -g pnpm` or just use the `package manager` you want.
